Design an experiment which can detect a 4-bit number if it is multiple of 3 or 2. If it is multiple of 3, it will turn on LED1, if it is multiple of multiple of 2 it will turn on LED2 and if it satisfies both of the conditions, both of the LEDs will be on. 
Inputs: [3:0] A - 4 bit binary input
Outputs: (Type LED) - M3 (Multiples of 3), M2 (Multiples of 2)
